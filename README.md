# configf5tof3f91-9
It is not so often we have a request to use to keyboard
 I'd use f1 - f-6 more often {MUSIC} the 'function' key introduction
-
-The function key is also related to power or solid UI displays (on other I/O)
f 8 - f 9  impliment the use, 'a same upfront display' with using f5
The request; Use and hold f 9 all the way to the last or formally known last f key (choose f 8) then press f 5...
[My keyboard actually goes to f 12 - and seems to have ink inside it lighting it up ,don't you know,]
...Tablets know this as ON or I/O when a button is clicked nothing happens. This is fix just by pressing the button again properly.
It also help align a rare use in a laptop when 15.1(distance) apart, they communicate with other I/O. Prompting the light, is this function use.
Ordinary I'd ignore the function line of keys. The request normally would come from a communication/any request.
 edge86 is not unlike other where it is dressing itself over again the same way. Using timestamp ability to show it's God like ability, edge is liken to the operating system, where it's settings respect the users I/O and formally introduses extra ability for display (unique tablet content)
 After saying it, the contain use is a free thing to do and I'd awit and buy a Tablet instead of going in the m.s junk catalogue (s)
 No one is missing out on a box that should appear rightly and information is pass directly as intended. Content is more upfront, considering the amount you pay for the Tablet , this , is a welcome service and standard. We all share the same and anything important is both upfront first for any user. (massive-citaion needed)
