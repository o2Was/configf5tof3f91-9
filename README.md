# configf5tof3f91-9
It is not so often we have a request to use to keyboard
 I'd use f1 - f-6 more often {MUSIC} the 'function' key introduction
-
-The function key is also related to power or solid UI displays (on other I/O)
f 8 - f 9  impliment the use, 'a same upfront display' with using f5
The request; Use and hold f 9 all the way to the last or formally known last f key (choose f 8) then press f 5...
[My keyboard actually goes to f 12 - and seems to have ink inside it lighting it up ,don't you know,]
...Tablets know this as ON or I/O when a button is clicked nothing happens. This is fix just by pressing the button again properly.
It also help align a rare use in a laptop when 15.1(distance) apart, they communicate with other I/O. Prompting the light, is this function use.
Ordinary I'd ignore the function line of keys. The request normally would come from a communication/any request.
