It is not so often we have a request to use to keyboard
If I knew I'd use f1 - f-6 more often the 'function' key introduction
-
-The function key is determain by trust and is also related to power or solid UI displays
f 8 - f 9 are for those uses, to impliment, a same upfront display using f5
The request is the same and a user computer use. Use the and hold f 9 all the way to the last or formally known last f key then press f 5
Tablets know this as ON or on I/O when a button is clicked nothing happens. This is fix just by pressing the button again properly.
It also help align a rare use in a laptop when 15.1(distance) apart, they communicate with other I/O. Prompting the light is this function use.
